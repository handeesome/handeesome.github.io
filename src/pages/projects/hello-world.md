# Hello, World!

## Introduction

This website started building on Feb 2024, and it is for me to keep track of what projects as well as study notes that I have done over the course of life-long studying.

The website currently is only a static website that is written by ReactJS. Many of the functionalities are broken for I am not very much familiar with the grand view of how a website should be structured in a top down fashion.

This website currently hosts on github pages and I will shift it to a domain name after I add the backend part of the website.

## TODO list

- Fix theme toggle to the root object so all components can be responsive
- Add Router functionality to Projects page.
- transplant the project auto-pptx from local app to a web app.
- change the README.MD from default react to customed
